# Type driven development

## What we will cover

* An interesting idea my coworker shared with me
* How I think about the idea

## Notes

The other day my coworker told me a story about a teacher he had in his university days.

This teacher would start by creating a type that represented how the program state would
look before anything happens.

He would then go to the end of the program and create a type that represented what state
the program should be in once everything is done.

Once that was done he would backtrack through the program until he reached the starting state,
implementing each step in the same manner.

Instead of writing top down and in steps like most people and how a program is executed,
this man had a very different way of thinking about his program.

The end result are the same but the process to get there is different.

This seemed very interesting!
